    <p> Week 2 - The concept of mail art is new to me and at first it was a difficult concept to understand. In this form of art, mail is said to not be the medium but the support. Mail art is not simply art that is sent through the mail but art that uses mail as an integral function of the work. The analogy of the monster is also very interesting in seeing how it applies to technology as we know it today as compared to 1979. In this case, the internet would be the 'big monster' and once we post a piece of art online we no longer have any control over it. We cannot decide what happens to it once it is posted and we are unable to fully gauge the response to it. Unlike the expenses of sending and producing mail art in large quantities- it is easier to reach millions of people nowadays and produce work at a much lower cost. </p>
   
    <p>Week 3 - I liked the idea that a website creator is both an author and architect- you have complete control of your identity unlike when using a big social media platform, which can be very empowering. I also think the idea of learning to assemble individual personal networks around different forms of knowledge is important in order to make a new sense of learning. This is a unique way of taking in knowledge that we can all benefit from in order to keep us wandering and evolving.</p>
    <p>Week 4 - The idea of a crossover between analog and digital being inevitable is very interesting to me. Access to the internet has become more widespread than ever and is an easy form for both publishers and consumers such as with blogs or online magazines. However people will always have a love for the printed materials. When the choice to read something online or in a book is given most people will choose a book. While publishing a book is not the most accessible, cheap, or environmentally friendly option, it still holds a lot of value in society.

        Zine production is an interesting look into this because of its accesibility and the visually symbolic information it tends to hold. Zines are carefully crafted and bound by individuals and so they are unique and hold a lot of value as a collector item.  The material characteristics of print are very important and play an essential role in the zine.
        
        I don't think the concept of on demand printing and binding is very possible because of all the extra materials and access needed. the addition of on demand customisable books sounds good in theory and I would like a 'book machine' myself but it would [probably be extremely expensive and hard to work. </p>
    <p>Week 5 - Through this reading, it was interesting to note the progression of social media over time. GeoCities was once popular and then became associated with dilettantism- how long till that happens with some of the websites and media we use today? Geocity pages were often decorated with borders- what could the equivalent be today?

        Geocities was unique in that it was like social media except you were entirely in control of how you showcased yourself or your interests. It provides a rich history frozen in time almost like a time capsule to the 90s and managed to create its own genre of 'digital folklore'. The web is constantly dying and evolving and we are continually moving from one popular media form to another- except, our history and our traces are much better preserved.</p>
<p> Week 6 - Price's 'Dispersion' is a fascinating exploration of art in the digital age. He challenges conventional ideas of authorship and distribution, which feels particularly relevant in our increasingly interconnected world. I was particularly struck by his examination of how digital technologies have transformed the way we create, distribute, and consume art. It made me think about the blurred lines between originality and replication, as well as the shifting roles of artists and audiences. Is this shift in perception of authorship liberating or does it pose challenges for artists?</p>
<p> Week 8 - "Alt-Text as Poetry Workbook" by Bojana Coklyat and Shannon Finnegan takes alt-text, usually just for describing images, and turns it into something creative and expressive. They use words that make pictures come alive, not just for people who can't see well, but for everyone. The workbook gives fun ideas to try with alt-text, making it more than just a practical thing.

    What's really cool is that it's a team effort. People work together, learning from each other, which makes it a shared adventure. This shows that making things accessible isn't just one person's job, but everyone's. Plus, the workbook talks about how alt-text can change how we see things, challenging what's normal and making room for different voices. This new way of looking at alt-text is exciting and makes digital spaces more welcoming for everyone.</p>

    <p> Week 9 - It is interesting to look at the trends within the digital graphic design landscape and the changes in surface and sign systems. The internet has created a space for infinitely multiplying surfaces and the hyperlinking of meaning. In this environment, chaos is standardized, but behind the facade is a web of meaning.  It is also interesting to look at how a simple graphic can hold so much meaning - "entire cultures are summarised in a quick graphic"- for example with Disney. </p>
<p> Week 10 - Ramsey Nasser's article talks about making computers that work for everyone, no matter where they come from. He says that right now, a lot of computer stuff is based on Western ideas and leaves out a bunch of other cultures. He suggests that we should design computers in ways that make sense and feel familiar to different groups of people.

    Nasser thinks it's important to let people customize their tech instead of giving them one-size-fits-all solutions. This way, they can make it suit their own needs and culture better. Overall, he's all about making technology a tool that empowers and includes everyone, no matter their background. this resonated with me because growing up when I was learning English I had trouble remembering that English was read left to right, unlike Arabic script.

<p> Week 12 - Vera Frenkel really connected with the internet when she started her project "Body Missing" in 1995. She felt like it was made just for her, aligning with her style of creating stories with no fixed endings. Looking back at her earlier work in 1974, "String Games," she used new technologies in a cool way. Imagine turning a traditional game like Cat's Cradle into a video performance between two cities! Frenkel's focus on playing around and making things up as they went along made String Games a big deal in the world of art and technology, even though people only recognized it many years later. This story shows how artists can find new ways to express themselves in the digital world.</p>

<p> Week 13 - Soulellis manages to combine technology and art and explores the intersection of digital spaces, identity, and culture. The title "Performing the Feed" sparked my curiosityâ€”what could it suggest about the constant stream of information in today's digital age? As I try to decode the project, the term "performance" in the title stands out. Does it hint at a dynamic interaction with the audience or perhaps a reflection on the performative nature of online presence? Considering Soulellis's history with technology, I'm curious about the role it plays in this specific piece. How does the use of tech enhance the experience, and does it invite viewers to actively engage with the artwork? </p>

<p> Week 14 - This was an interesting tween zine about time traveling and overthrowing master technologies. It explored the concept of power and how history impacts technology and relates to how black people are treated even today. I enjoyed the comic book/children's book style and I think it was a good introduction to how we may feel controlled by the internet and our computers but they do not have to define who we are. Important issues of gentrification and racism were brought up such as being followed around a store by a police officer and how there is gentrification in Philadelphia by our university. The master/slave dynamic has been brought to technology which is being used against black people and people of color with the erasure of history and truth. This is unfortunately still happening today in the political sphere. Computers are powerful tools and can empower people who know how to use them properly.

 </p>

 <p> Week 15 - Hito Steyerl's essay "Can Art Workers Think?" makes you rethink what it means to be an artist today. She argues that artists aren't just creating in a bubble but are part of the bigger world, with a responsibility to engage in social and political issues. This challenges the idea of the artist as a solitary genius. For us, as students interested in the arts, it prompts questions about our role in society and how our work can make a real impact.

    Steyerl also talks about how money and the art market influence what gets made and seen. As future art workers, we need to think about the balance between creating what matters to us and dealing with the pressures of the art business. Her essay pushes us to be aware of the power structures in the art world and to consider the ethical side of our choices. In a nutshell, Steyerl encourages us to be artists who think critically and shape the conversations happening around us, making us aware of the potential our work has to influence the world.</p>
